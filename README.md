# Red-Team-vs-Blue-Team

A scenario where my team played the role of both penetration tester and SOC analyst. As Red Team we attacked a vulnerable VM in order to gain root access to the machine while Blue Team Kibana was used to analyze and review logs taken during the Red Team engagement. Using the logs we extracted hard data and created visualizations for a report.

The project had me apply knowledge with the following skills and tools:

- Penetration testing with Kali Linux.

- Log and incident analysis with Kibana.

- System hardening and configuration.

- Reporting, documentation, and communication.
